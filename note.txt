To set up vim environment, copy .vimrc and .vim to ~/.
Then clone Vundle to .vim/:
    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Vim plugin 'YouCompleteMe' needs manual compilation and installation.
Just execute the script install.py in .vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/ and it will
be fine.
